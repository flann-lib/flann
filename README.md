FLANN - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
======================================================

FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found to work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically choosing the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset.
FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: C, MATLAB, Python, and Ruby.

Getting FLANN
-------------

You can download and install FLANN using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    vcpkg install flann

The FLANN port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

If you want to try out the latest changes or contribute to FLANN, then it's recommended that you checkout the git source repository: `git clone git://github.com/mariusmuja/flann.git`

If you just want to browse the repository, you can do so by going [here](https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann).
